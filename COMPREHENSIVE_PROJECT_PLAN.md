## Development Workflow

### Daily Workflow (Each PR)

#### Morning (Start of Day)
1. Check Firestore usage (Firebase Console > Firestore > Usage)
   - Should be <$1/day during development
   - If >$1: investigate for rogue writes
2. Pull latest main: `git pull origin main`
3. Verify dev server works: `npm run dev`

#### During Development
1. Work on assigned tasks from COMPREHENSIVE_TASK_LIST.md
2. Commit frequently: `git add . && git commit -m "feat: description"`
3. After each task, run checks:
   ```bash
   npm run type-check      # TypeScript
   npm run dev             # Verify dev server
   npm test                # If tests exist
   ```
4. Test in 2 browsers (Chrome + Incognito) for sync verification
5. Document in commit message what you tested

#### End of Day (Before PR Merge)
1. Final checks:
   ```bash
   npm run build           # Production build
   npm run type-check      # No TypeScript errors
   npm test                # All tests pass
   ```
2. Clean up code (remove console.logs, unused vars)
3. Commit final changes: `git add . && git commit -m "chore: cleanup before merge"`
4. Merge to main: `git checkout main && git merge feature/...`

#### Deployment (After PR Merge)
1. Deploy to production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   firebase deploy
   ```
2. Wait for deployment (~2 min)
3. Test at https://collabcanvas-mvp.web.app
4. Verify features work
5. Document in GitHub what was deployed

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Per PR)
- Add `*.test.tsx` for each new component
- Test in isolation with mock props
- Quick feedback loop

### Integration Tests
- Test with 2-5 concurrent users
- Test real-time sync for each feature
- Test with mixed shape types
- Performance test: 500+ shapes

### Manual Testing Checklist (Each PR)
- [ ] Feature works locally (dev server)
- [ ] TypeScript compilation: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] 60 FPS maintained (check devtools)
- [ ] Feature syncs across browsers
- [ ] Feature persists on refresh
- [ ] Error states handled gracefully
- [ ] No console errors or warnings

### Deployment Testing
- [ ] Deploy to staging/preview
- [ ] Test with 5+ concurrent users
- [ ] Monitor Firestore costs
- [ ] Check performance metrics
- [ ] Verify all features work in production

---

## Performance Targets

### Rendering
- **60 FPS** during all interactions
- **500+ shapes** without FPS drops
- Smooth pan/zoom
- No jank

### Sync
- **<100ms** for shape changes
- **<50ms** for cursor updates
- **<30s** for initial load
- Real-time vs batch appropriate

### AI
- **<2 seconds** for single-step commands
- **<3 seconds** for multi-step commands
- **<$1/month** usage for testing
- Function calls via API

### Cost Tracking
- **Firestore <$15/month**
- **Claude <$5/month**
- **Hosting <$3/month**
- **Total: <$25/month**

---

## Risk Management

### Known Challenges & Solutions

#### Challenge 1: Multi-Shape Rendering Performance
**Problem:** Drawing 500 mixed shapes might impact FPS

**Solution:**
- Use Konva's built-in caching
- Cache static shapes, invalidate on update
- Consider lazy-loading offscreen shapes
- Monitor with Chrome DevTools Rendering tab

#### Challenge 2: AI Token Costs
**Problem:** Claude API calls could accumulate costs

**Solution:**
- Budget: 1000 AI commands/month = ~$1
- Implement rate limiting (1 command per 2 seconds)
- Monitor Claude API usage daily

#### Challenge 3: Firestore Write Limits
**Problem:** High concurrency could spike costs

**Solution:**
- 5 users × 10 operations/min = 50 writes/min
- Implement batch writes for high-frequency ops
- Monitor usage: Firebase Console > Firestore > Usage

#### Challenge 4: Real-Time Sync Conflicts
**Problem:** Multiple users editing same shape

**Solution:**
- Lock-based prevention (already implemented)
- Last-write-wins for properties
- Clear documentation in PR #18

#### Challenge 5: AI Hallucination
**Problem:** AI might create invalid shapes

**Solution:**
- Validate all tool inputs before execution
- Show AI's interpretation to user
- Implement undo (PR #14 ✅ DONE)
- Test prompts with edge cases

### Rollback Plan

If a PR breaks production:

**Immediate:**
1. Identify which PR caused the issue (check git log)
2. Revert: `git revert <commit-hash>`
3. Deploy: `firebase deploy`
4. Should be live within 2-3 minutes

**Post-Incident:**
1. Pull code locally
2. Reproduce bug with exact steps
3. Fix and test locally (2 browsers)
4. Commit with clear message: `fix: description of what broke`
5. Re-deploy with confidence

## Communication & Escalation

### If You Get Stuck
1. **TypeScript errors:** Check task description, review type definitions
2. **Firestore sync not working:** Verify security rules are deployed
3. **Performance issues:** Check DevTools performance tab
4. **AI prompt not working:** Log Claude response, adjust prompt
5. **Merge conflicts:** Communicate scope, rebase if needed

### Questions to Ask Yourself
- "Did I test this with 2 concurrent users?"
- "Does this maintain 60 FPS?"
- "Did I commit frequently with clear messages?"
- "Did I check Firestore costs today?"
- "Did I test the happy path AND error cases?"
