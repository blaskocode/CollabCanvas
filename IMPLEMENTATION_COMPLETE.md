## üêõ Known Issues / Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **AI Agent Requires API Key** - Need to add Claude API key to `.env`
2. **AI Can't Select Shapes** - AI creates shapes but can't reference existing ones for updates (limitation: no way to know shape IDs after creation)
3. **Bundle Size Warning** - 394 KB (acceptable, but could be optimized with code splitting)

### Minor UX Improvements (Not Required)
- Multi-select box could be more visible
- Undo/redo could show action descriptions
- AI could provide more feedback on complex commands

### Not Implemented (By Design)
- Export/Import (PR #15) - Not on rubric
- Advanced animations (PR #17) - Not on rubric
- Help modal (PR #17) - Not on rubric
