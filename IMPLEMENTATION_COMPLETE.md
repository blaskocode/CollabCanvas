## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Manual Workflow Creation
1. Click workflow shape buttons in toolbar (Process, Decision, Start/End, Document, Database)
2. Draw shapes on canvas
3. Double-click shapes to add text
4. Drag shapes to position

### 2. AI Workflow Generation
Type natural language commands:
- "Design code, write code, test code, deploy code"
- "If tests pass deploy, if not send email"
- "Start, fetch from database, validate data, save to database, end"

The AI will:
- Create appropriate workflow shapes
- Connect them with arrows
- Add labels to decision branches
- Layout shapes properly

### 3. Editing Workflows
- Select shapes and connections
- Press Delete to remove
- Drag shapes - connections follow automatically
- Double-click to edit text
- Use property panel for styling
