## Testing Requirements üß™

### Unit Tests Needed
- [ ] Anchor point calculation tests
- [ ] Connection path computation tests
- [ ] Workflow layout algorithm tests
- [ ] Shape text fitting tests

### Integration Tests Needed
- [ ] Connection creation and persistence
- [ ] Shape movement with connected connectors
- [ ] AI workflow generation end-to-end
- [ ] Voice input transcription
- [ ] Double-click text editing

### Manual Testing Scenarios
- [ ] Simple sequential workflow creation
- [ ] Decision tree with branches
- [ ] Complex database workflow
- [ ] Voice-generated workflow
- [ ] Multi-user collaborative workflow editing

## Known Issues & Next Steps üîß

### Critical (Must Fix)
1. CanvasContext needs full connection state management
2. Canvas.tsx needs workflow shape rendering
3. Connection mode UI needs implementation
4. Voice input needs implementation

### Important (Should Fix)
5. Inline text editor needs integration with Canvas
6. Anchor points need to show during connection mode
7. CanvasControls needs workflow shape buttons
8. AI agent needs testing with complex workflows

### Nice to Have (Future)
9. Bezier curve connectors (currently straight lines)
10. Auto-routing around shapes
11. Connector rerouting by dragging
12. Multi-language voice support
13. Workflow validation (detect incomplete paths)
14. Export workflows as images
