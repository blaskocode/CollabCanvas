# Canvas Pan/Zoom Improvements

## Problem Summary

When zoomed out to minimum zoom level, the canvas would get stuck on the right side of the viewport. Even when dragging it to the center, it would revert back to the right side. This created a frustrating user experience.

## Zoom Configuration

**Minimum Zoom:** Fixed at **10%** (0.1) in all cases
- Allows users to see the entire 5000x5000 canvas from a bird's eye view
- Provides consistent zoom behavior regardless of viewport size
- Defined in `constants.ts` as `MIN_ZOOM = 0.1`

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by **inverted constraint logic** when the canvas was smaller than the viewport:

1. **Flawed constraint calculations**: The code assumed the canvas was always larger than the viewport, leading to impossible constraints (minX > maxX) when zoomed out.

2. **Forced auto-centering**: The canvas was forcibly centered whenever the zoom level equaled `minZoom`, fighting against user pan attempts.

3. **Inconsistent behavior**: The same flawed constraint logic was used in both manual panning and auto-pan (during shape dragging).

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Context-Aware Pan Constraints

Replaced the one-size-fits-all constraint logic with **context-aware constraints** that check whether the canvas is larger or smaller than the viewport:

**When canvas is larger than viewport (zoomed in):**
- Apply tight bounds to keep at least 100px of canvas visible
- Prevents users from panning too far off-screen

**When canvas fits within viewport (zoomed out):**
- Apply gentle bounds that allow free positioning
- Allows canvas to be positioned anywhere with minimal (100px) padding constraints
- No more stuck canvas!

### 2. Removed Forced Centering

- **Removed** auto-centering behavior during scroll wheel zoom at minimum zoom
- **Removed** auto-centering behavior during zoom button clicks at minimum zoom
- **Kept** centering only for the explicit "Reset View" button

Now users can zoom all the way out and position the canvas wherever they want for composition.

### 3. Consistent Implementation

Applied the same context-aware constraint logic to:
- ✅ Manual stage dragging (`handleStageDragEnd`)
- ✅ Auto-pan during shape dragging (near viewport edges)
- ✅ Scroll wheel zooming (`handleWheel`)
- ✅ Button-based zooming (`handleZoomIn`, `handleZoomOut`)

## Changes Made

### File: `collabcanvas/src/components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx`

#### 1. Updated `handleStageDragEnd` (lines 300-356)
- Added context-aware constraint logic
- Separate handling for horizontal and vertical constraints
- Different constraint calculations based on canvas vs viewport size

#### 2. Updated `handleWheel` (lines 358-397)
- Removed forced centering at minimum zoom
- Now always zooms toward cursor position smoothly

#### 3. Updated `handleZoomOut` (lines 430-460)
- Removed forced centering at minimum zoom
- Consistent zoom behavior at all zoom levels

#### 4. Updated auto-pan constraints (lines 207-252)
- Applied same context-aware logic to auto-pan during shape dragging
- Ensures smooth panning even when dragging shapes near edges at low zoom

### File: `collabcanvas/src/components/UI/ColorPicker.tsx`
- Fixed TypeScript linting error: removed unused `hsvToHex` import

### File: `collabcanvas/src/utils/constants.ts`
- `MIN_ZOOM` already set to 0.1 (10%) - no changes needed

### Updated: Fixed Minimum Zoom
- **Removed** dynamic minimum zoom calculation that varied based on viewport size
- **Changed** to fixed 10% minimum zoom in all cases
- Removed `minZoom` state variable from Canvas component
- Updated all references to use `MIN_ZOOM` constant directly
- Simplified resize handler logic

## User Experience Improvements

### Before:
- ❌ Canvas stuck on right side when zoomed out
- ❌ Dragging didn't work properly at minimum zoom
- ❌ Frustrating fight with auto-centering
- ❌ Inconsistent behavior across zoom levels

### After:
- ✅ Canvas can be positioned freely at all zoom levels
- ✅ Smooth, professional-feeling pan behavior
- ✅ No more sudden snapping or reverting
- ✅ Consistent experience whether zoomed in or out
- ✅ Users can compose their view as they prefer
- ✅ "Reset View" button still centers canvas when explicitly requested

## Technical Details

### Constraint Logic (Zoomed Out)
```typescript
// When canvas fits within viewport
const maxX = dimensions.width - scaledCanvasWidth + 100;
const minX = -100;
```

This allows the canvas to be positioned from 100px off the left edge to 100px off the right edge, giving users full freedom while preventing the canvas from disappearing entirely.

### Constraint Logic (Zoomed In)
```typescript
// When canvas is larger than viewport
const padding = 100;
const maxX = padding;
const minX = -(scaledCanvasWidth - dimensions.width + padding);
```

This ensures at least 100px of canvas remains visible at all times, preventing users from getting lost.

## Testing

### Build Status
✅ TypeScript compilation successful
✅ Vite production build successful
✅ No linting errors

### Manual Testing Recommended
1. Zoom all the way out using scroll wheel or button
2. Try dragging canvas to different positions
3. Verify canvas stays where you put it
4. Test "Reset View" button - should center canvas
5. Zoom in and test panning at various zoom levels
6. Drag shapes near viewport edges at minimum zoom to test auto-pan

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Visual Feedback**
   - Add subtle canvas border to make boundaries clear
   - Consider a minimap for spatial awareness

2. **Infinite Canvas Mode**
   - Remove all constraints for a truly infinite canvas experience
   - Add "back to canvas" button if user pans too far

3. **Smart Centering**
   - Center on actual content instead of geometric center
   - "Fit to content" button to zoom to show all shapes

4. **Performance**
   - Consider throttling constraint calculations for very large canvases
   - Optimize auto-pan loop for 60fps on all devices
