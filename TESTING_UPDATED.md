# Updated Testing Guide - PR #14 with UX Improvements

## 🎉 What's New

### Improved Canvas Interaction!
- ✅ **Two-finger gestures** now pan the canvas (trackpad/touch)
- ✅ **Space + drag** now pans the canvas (mouse)  
- ✅ **Single-click drag** now does box selection (no confusing threshold!)
- ✅ **Visual cursor feedback** (grab/grabbing cursor)

---

## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. **Test Undo/Redo** (Main PR #14 Feature)

#### Create & Undo:
1. Click the **"Rectangle" button** in the right panel
2. A rectangle appears on the canvas
3. Look at the **top of the right panel** - see the **green "Undo" button**
4. Click **Undo** (or press **Ctrl+Z**)
5. ✓ Rectangle disappears!
6. Click **Redo** (cyan button, or press **Ctrl+Y**)
7. ✓ Rectangle reappears!

#### Test Other Operations:
- **Move a shape** → Undo → shape moves back
- **Resize a shape** → Undo → size restores
- **Change color** → Undo → color reverts
- **Delete a shape** (Delete key) → Undo → shape returns
- **Duplicate** (Ctrl+D) → Undo → duplicate removed
