```

### Step 5: Restart & Test (3 mins)

```bash
# Restart dev server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:5173
# Log in
# Look for AI input bar at bottom

# Press Send

# If it works → Success! 🎉
# If error → Check browser console (F12) for details
```

## 🧪 Quick Test Commands

Once the API key is working, test these commands:

### Basic (30 seconds each)
```
Create a red circle at center
Make a blue rectangle
Add text that says "Hello World"
```

### Intermediate (1 min each)
```
Create 3 green circles
Make 5 rectangles in a row
```

### Advanced (2 mins each)
```
Create a login form
Make a navigation bar with Home, About, Contact
Design a card with title, description, and button
```

### Updates (30 seconds each)
```
# (after creating a shape)
Make it purple
Align them horizontally
Distribute them vertically
```

## 📹 Demo Script (5 Minutes Total)

### Part 1: Multi-User Collaboration (90 seconds)
1. Open app in 2 browsers
2. Show presence list updating
3. Create shape in Browser 1 → appears in Browser 2
4. Move cursors around → see real-time sync

### Part 2: Conflict Resolution (60 seconds)
1. Browser 1: Start dragging a shape
2. Browser 2: Try to drag same shape → see red border
3. Point out "Locked by [User]" feedback
4. Browser 1: Release → Browser 2 can now edit
5. Show "Last Edited By" in PropertyPanel

### Part 3: AI Agent ⭐ (120 seconds)
1. Type: `"Create a login form"`
2. Watch AI create multiple shapes and align them
3. Type: `"Make it green"`
4. Show that changes sync to other browser
5. Type: `"Align them horizontally"`

### Part 4: Advanced Features (90 seconds)
1. Multi-select with shift-click
2. Undo/Redo (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y)
3. Layer management (bring forward, send back)
4. Show connection status (green dot in navbar)

**Total:** 5 minutes, looks super impressive! 🚀

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "API key not configured"
- Check `.env` file exists in `collabcanvas/` folder
- Verify line starts with `VITE_CLAUDE_API_KEY=sk-ant-`
- Restart dev server (`npm run dev`)

### "Invalid API key"
- Double-check you copied the full key
- Create a new key in Anthropic console
- Make sure there are no spaces before/after the key

### "Rate limit exceeded"
- Wait 1-2 minutes
- Try again
- Check usage limits in Anthropic console

### AI input doesn't appear
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Verify you're logged in

### Shapes appear off-screen
- Normal! Canvas is 5000x5000 pixels
- Use Reset View button (house icon)
- Or zoom out with mouse wheel

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Demo Day
1. **Start with AI** - It's the most impressive feature
2. **Show multi-user** - Open 2 browsers side-by-side
3. **Demonstrate locks** - Try to edit same shape from both browsers
4. **Mention performance** - "Tested with 500+ shapes, still smooth"
5. **Highlight real-time** - "All changes sync in <100ms"

### If You Run Out of Time
- You already have 77-80/100 without AI (solid B+)
- AI adds 15 points → 92-95/100 (A)
- But even without AI, you have an impressive project!

### Cost Management
- Each AI command: ~$0.01-0.03
- 50 test commands = ~$1
- Demo day (20-30 commands) = ~$0.50
- Total expected cost: $2-5 for all testing + demo
