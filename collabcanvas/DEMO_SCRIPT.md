## Demo Tips

### Do's ‚úÖ
- **Practice first**: Run through the script 2-3 times before recording
- **Speak clearly**: Explain what you're doing as you do it
- **Go slow**: Give viewers time to see what's happening
- **Show sync delays**: Pause briefly to show how fast changes appear
- **Emphasize key features**: Real-time sync, cursors, locking
- **Test beforehand**: Ensure all features work before demo

### Don'ts ‚ùå
- **Don't rush**: Take your time, especially with real-time features
- **Don't skip authentication**: Shows security is built-in
- **Don't use too many shapes**: 20-30 is enough to show performance
- **Don't ignore errors**: If something breaks, acknowledge it
- **Don't forget to show presence**: Key differentiator from single-user tools

## Follow-Up Content Ideas

After the main demo, consider creating:

1. **Technical Deep Dive** (for developers)
   - Architecture overview
   - Firebase integration
   - Real-time sync implementation
   - Performance optimizations

2. **Use Case Demos**
   - Design team collaboration
   - Remote whiteboarding
   - Brainstorming sessions
   - Education/teaching scenarios

3. **Feature Highlights** (short videos)
   - Just cursors and presence
   - Just locking mechanism
   - Just offline support
   - Just performance
