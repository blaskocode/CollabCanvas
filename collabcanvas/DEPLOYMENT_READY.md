## 🚀 Next Steps for Deployment

### Step 1: Firebase Login

```bash
cd /Users/courtneyblaskovich/Documents/Projects/CollabCanvas/collabcanvas
firebase login
```

This will open a browser for Firebase authentication.

### Step 2: Configure Your Firebase Project

Copy the example file and add your project ID:

```bash
cp .firebaserc.example .firebaserc
```

Edit `.firebaserc` and replace `your-firebase-project-id` with your actual project ID (from Firebase Console).

**Example:**
```json
{
  "projects": {
    "default": "collabcanvas-mvp-12345"
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Deploy Security Rules

```bash
# Deploy Firestore rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Deploy Realtime Database rules
firebase deploy --only database
```

### Step 4: Deploy the Application

```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

**Expected output:**
```
✔ Deploy complete!

Project Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/your-project/overview
Hosting URL: https://your-project.web.app
```

### Step 5: Test the Deployed Application

Open the Hosting URL in 2-3 browsers and test:

**Authentication:**
- [ ] Sign up with email/password
- [ ] Log in with email/password
- [ ] Sign in with Google
- [ ] Log out

**Canvas Features:**
- [ ] Create shapes
- [ ] Move shapes
- [ ] Delete shapes (Delete/Backspace key)
- [ ] Deselect shapes (Escape key)
- [ ] Pan canvas
- [ ] Zoom in/out

**Real-Time Collaboration (2+ browsers):**
- [ ] Create shape in Browser 1 → appears in Browser 2
- [ ] Move shape in Browser 1 → syncs to Browser 2
- [ ] Delete shape in Browser 1 → disappears from Browser 2
- [ ] Cursors visible for both users
- [ ] Presence list shows both users
- [ ] Object locking works (one user at a time)

**Performance:**
- [ ] 60 FPS during pan/zoom
- [ ] Create 50+ shapes quickly → no lag
- [ ] All shapes sync correctly

**Persistence:**
- [ ] Refresh browser → shapes persist
- [ ] Close and reopen → shapes persist
- [ ] All users leave → return → shapes persist

### Step 6: Update README with Live Demo Link

Once deployed and tested, update `README.md`:

```markdown
## 🚀 Live Demo

**[Try CollabCanvas Live](https://your-project.web.app)**

Try it with 2-3 browser windows to see real-time collaboration in action!
```

## 🐛 Known Issues (Documented)

All known issues are documented in `README.md` under "Known Limitations & Issues":

**MVP Scope Limitations:**
1. Single shape type (rectangles only)
2. No shape styling (fixed gray color)
3. No resize/rotate
4. No multi-select
5. No undo/redo
6. Fixed canvas size (5000x5000px)
7. Desktop only
8. Single global canvas
9. No shape layers
10. Basic locking (not CRDT/OT)

**Known Technical Issues:**
1. Firestore persistence warnings in Safari (can be ignored)
2. Lock timeout after 5 seconds
3. Offline sync queuing
4. Performance with 1000+ shapes

All have documented workarounds and are acceptable for MVP.
