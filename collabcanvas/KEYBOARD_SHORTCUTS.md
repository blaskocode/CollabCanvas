## Platform-Specific Notes

### macOS
- `Cmd` key is equivalent to `Ctrl` on Windows/Linux
- All shortcuts work the same with `Cmd` instead of `Ctrl`

### Windows/Linux
- Use `Ctrl` for all modifier shortcuts
- Some browsers may have conflicting shortcuts (e.g., `Ctrl+'` for zoom)

## Troubleshooting

### Shortcuts Not Working?
1. Make sure you're not in a text input field
2. Check that the canvas has focus (click on canvas first)
3. Some shortcuts are disabled in drawing/placement mode

### Conflicting Browser Shortcuts?
Some browsers may intercept certain shortcuts:
- `Ctrl+'` might trigger browser zoom in some browsers
- Use button controls as alternative if shortcuts conflict
