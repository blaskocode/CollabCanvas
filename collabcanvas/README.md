## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd CollabCanvas/collabcanvas
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Firebase

Follow the detailed guide in `FIREBASE_SETUP.md` to:
- Create a Firebase project

- Create Firestore database
- Create Realtime Database
- Get your Firebase configuration

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and add your Firebase credentials:

VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://your_project_id-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com
VITE_APP_ENV=development
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Never commit your `.env` file to version control!**

### 5. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## üìú Available Scripts

- `tests/integration/` - Integration tests
- `tests/setup.ts` - Test configuration

### Multi-User Testing

To test real-time collaboration features:

1. **Open multiple browser windows** (or use incognito/private mode):
   - Chrome + Chrome Incognito
   - Chrome + Firefox
   - Or use different browsers

2. **Sign in as different users** in each window

3. **Test the following scenarios**:
   - Create shapes in one window ‚Üí verify they appear in other windows
   - Move shapes in one window ‚Üí verify movement syncs to others
   - Delete shapes ‚Üí verify deletion syncs immediately
   - Check cursor tracking ‚Üí each user's cursor should show their name
   - Verify presence list ‚Üí all online users should be visible in navbar
   - Test offline mode ‚Üí disconnect network, make changes, reconnect

4. **Expected Performance**:
   - Shape changes should sync in <100ms
   - Cursor positions should update in <50ms (throttled to ~30 FPS)
   - 60 FPS maintained during pan/zoom
   - Should support 500+ shapes without FPS drops
   - 5+ concurrent users without performance degradation

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Delete/Backspace**: Delete selected shape
- **Escape**: Deselect current selection
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out
- **Drag Canvas**: Pan the canvas (when not dragging a shape)

## üî• Firebase Configuration

This app uses three Firebase services:

1. **Authentication** - User login and identity management
2. **Cloud Firestore** - Persistent canvas state (shapes)
3. **Realtime Database** - Real-time cursors and presence

### Security Rules

Security rules are configured to require authentication:

**Firestore Rules:**
```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /canvas/{canvasId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

**Realtime Database Rules:**
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "sessions": {
      "$canvasId": {
        ".read": "auth != null",
        ".write": "auth != null"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For detailed Firebase setup instructions, see `FIREBASE_SETUP.md`.

## üé® Key Concepts

### Object Locking

To prevent conflicts in real-time collaboration:
- First user to select/drag an object acquires a lock
- Other users cannot move locked objects
- Lock releases automatically when drag completes
- Lock timeout after 5 seconds of inactivity
- Visual indicators show which user has locked an object

### Canvas Boundaries

- Canvas size: 5000x5000 pixels
- Objects cannot be moved outside boundaries
- Pan and zoom keep you within the canvas
- Zoom range: 0.1x to 3x

### Real-Time Synchronization

- **Shape changes**: <100ms sync time via Firestore
- **Cursor positions**: <50ms sync time via Realtime Database
- **Presence updates**: Real-time via Realtime Database
- **Offline support**: Automatic sync when reconnected

## üåê Browser Compatibility

### Supported Browsers (Tested)

- ‚úÖ **Chrome** 100+ (Recommended)
- ‚úÖ **Firefox** 100+
- ‚úÖ **Safari** 15.4+
- ‚úÖ **Edge** 100+

### Known Browser-Specific Issues

- **Safari**: May show occasional "Persistence failed" warnings in console (can be safely ignored)
- **Firefox**: Canvas rendering is slightly slower than Chrome but still performant
- **Mobile Browsers**: Currently not optimized for mobile/tablet devices (desktop-only for MVP)

### Recommended Setup for Testing

- **Primary**: Chrome or Edge (best performance)
- **Secondary**: Firefox (for cross-browser testing)
- Use **incognito/private** mode for multi-user testing on same device

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations & Issues

### MVP Scope Limitations

These are intentional limitations of the MVP and will be addressed in future releases:

1. **Single Shape Type**: Only rectangles supported (no circles, text, lines, etc.)
2. **No Shape Styling**: Fixed gray fill color (#cccccc), no custom colors or borders
3. **No Resize/Rotate**: Cannot resize or rotate shapes after creation
4. **No Multi-Select**: Can only select one shape at a time
5. **No Undo/Redo**: No history or command system
6. **Fixed Canvas Size**: 5000x5000px canvas (not infinite)
7. **Desktop Only**: Not optimized for mobile/tablet devices
8. **Single Global Canvas**: All users collaborate on one shared canvas (no project management)
9. **No Shape Layers**: All shapes on single layer, no z-index control
10. **Basic Locking**: Simple first-to-drag locking (not CRDT or OT based)

### Known Technical Issues

1. **Firestore Persistence Warnings**:
   - May see "Persistence failed" in Safari console
   - Can be safely ignored - app will still work with network-only mode
   - Workaround: Clear browser cache or use Chrome

2. **Lock Timeout**:
   - If user's browser crashes, lock releases after 5 seconds
   - Other users will need to wait briefly before editing locked shapes

3. **Offline Sync**:
   - Changes made offline will queue and sync when reconnected
   - Large numbers of offline changes may take several seconds to sync

4. **Performance with Many Shapes**:
   - 500+ shapes tested and performant
   - 1000+ shapes may cause slight FPS drops on slower devices
   - Recommendation: Use zoom/pan to focus on specific areas

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Firebase Connection Issues

**Problem**: "Missing required environment variables"
- **Solution**: Check that your `.env` file has all Firebase config variables set

**Problem**: "Permission denied" when accessing Firestore/RTDB
- **Solution**: Verify security rules are deployed and you're authenticated

**Problem**: Can't find Realtime Database URL
- **Solution**: Go to Realtime Database in Firebase Console, URL is shown at the top

**Problem**: "Persistence failed" warnings in console
- **Solution**: These are safe to ignore. The app uses Firestore's new persistence API which may show warnings in some browsers. App functionality is not affected.

### Development Server Issues

**Problem**: Port 5173 already in use
```bash
# Kill existing process
kill -9 $(lsof -ti:5173)

# Or use a different port
npm run dev -- --port 3000
```

**Problem**: TypeScript errors after pulling changes
```bash
# Clean install dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Check types
npm run type-check
```

**Problem**: Shapes not syncing between users
- **Solution**: 
  1. Check that both users are authenticated
  2. Verify Firebase security rules are deployed
  3. Check browser console for errors
  4. Try refreshing both browser windows

**Problem**: Cursors not showing
- **Solution**:
  1. Verify Realtime Database is enabled in Firebase Console
  2. Check that RTDB URL is correct in `.env`
  3. Ensure both users are on the canvas (not login page)

### Performance Issues

**Problem**: Canvas feels laggy or slow
- **Solution**:
  1. Check if you have 100+ shapes on canvas (try deleting some)
  2. Close other resource-intensive browser tabs
  3. Use Chrome for best performance
  4. Check if your zoom level is very low (<20%)

**Problem**: High Firestore read/write counts
- **Solution**: This is expected with real-time collaboration. Each shape operation creates read/write events. Firebase free tier includes 50k reads and 20k writes per day, which is sufficient for testing.

## üöÄ Deployment

CollabCanvas uses Firebase Hosting for deployment.

### Quick Deployment

```bash
# 1. Login to Firebase
firebase login

# 2. Link your Firebase project
cp .firebaserc.example .firebaserc
# Edit .firebaserc with your project ID

# 3. Deploy security rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
firebase deploy --only database

# 4. Build and deploy
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```
