# Firebase Permissions Fix Summary

## Problem
Users experienced "Missing or insufficient permissions" errors when trying to read/write canvas data.

## Root Cause
**Collection Name Mismatch**: The code was trying to access the `'canvas'` collection, but Firestore security rules only allowed access to `'canvases'` collection.

## Solution
Changed the collection name in `src/services/canvas.ts`:
```typescript
// Before:
const CANVAS_COLLECTION = 'canvas';

// After:
const CANVAS_COLLECTION = 'canvases';
```

## Key Files Modified
1. **src/services/canvas.ts** - Fixed collection name to `'canvases'`
2. **src/services/firebase.ts** - Re-enabled offline persistence
3. **src/hooks/useCanvas.ts** - Simplified subscription logic
4. **src/services/connections.ts** - Cleaned up debug code
5. **firestore.rules** - Removed temporary migration rules

## What Was Cleaned Up
- ✅ Removed all debug console.log statements
- ✅ Removed temporary auth token verification functions
- ✅ Removed migration utilities (clear-cache.ts, migrate-collection.ts)
- ✅ Removed temporary Firestore rules for old collection
- ✅ Re-enabled offline persistence (now safe since collection name is fixed)
- ✅ Moved troubleshooting docs to `docs/troubleshooting/`

## Result
✅ All permission errors resolved
✅ Shapes, groups, and connections sync correctly
✅ Real-time collaboration works
✅ All workflow features operational
✅ Clean, production-ready code

## For Future Reference
If you see permission errors again:
1. Check Firestore rules match collection names in code
2. Verify user is authenticated
3. Check Firebase Console for quota limits
4. See `docs/troubleshooting/` for detailed guides
