    - Canvas should NOT shift when dragging objects in the center of viewport ✅
    - ONLY auto-pan when shape is dragged near the edge of the viewport (within 50px of viewport edge) ✅
    - Auto-pan should be smooth and gradual (not jumpy) ✅
    - Pan direction should match the direction of the drag ✅
    - Must not conflict with stage's native draggable property ✅
    - Auto-pan should stop immediately when drag ends ✅
  - Files updated: `src/components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx`, `src/components/Canvas/Shape.tsx`, `src/utils/constants.ts`
  - **Critical Fixes**:
    - **STAGE DRAGGING DISABLED DURING SHAPE DRAG**: Set `draggable={!isDraggingShape}` on Stage to prevent canvas movement when dragging shapes ✅

- [x] **4.10: Fix Dynamic Minimum Zoom to Fit Canvas** ✅ COMPLETED 🐛 BUG FIX

  - **Issue**: When zoomed out to minimum (10%), canvas locks to upper-right corner and user can see outside canvas boundaries
  - **Requirements**:
    - Minimum zoom should be calculated dynamically based on viewport dimensions ✅
    - At minimum zoom, ENTIRE canvas (5000x5000px) should be visible in viewport ✅
    - Allow seeing full larger dimension, even if smaller dimension has empty space ✅
    - Minimum zoom = min(viewportWidth/canvasWidth, viewportHeight/canvasHeight) ✅
    - Uses smaller ratio to ensure entire canvas fits in viewport ✅
    - Canvas should be CENTERED horizontally or vertically at minimum zoom ✅
    - Recalculate minimum zoom on window resize ✅
  - Files updated: `src/components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx`, `src/components/Canvas/CanvasControls.tsx`
  - Implementation:
    - Added `minZoom` state variable calculated dynamically ✅
    - Calculate minimum zoom in resize handler using `Math.min(width/CANVAS_WIDTH, height/CANVAS_HEIGHT)` ✅
    - Takes SMALLER ratio to ensure entire canvas is visible ✅
    - Initial calculation on component mount ✅
    - Update min zoom on window resize ✅
    - Auto-adjust current zoom if below new minimum ✅
    - Applied minimum zoom constraint to all zoom operations (wheel, zoom out button) ✅
    - Pass `minZoom` to CanvasControls component ✅
    - Updated CanvasControls to use dynamic minZoom instead of static MIN_ZOOM ✅
    - Zoom out button correctly disables at calculated minimum ✅
    - **CENTERING LOGIC**: Added `centerCanvasAtMinZoom()` function ✅
    - Centers canvas horizontally if viewport width > scaled canvas width ✅
    - Centers canvas vertically if viewport height > scaled canvas height ✅
    - Centering applied when: zooming to minimum (wheel/button), window resize, reset view ✅
    - Reset view now zooms to minimum and centers (instead of zoom 1 at 0,0) ✅

**PR Checklist:**

- [x] Can create rectangles via button ✅
- [x] Rectangles render at correct positions with gray fill ✅
- [x] Can select rectangles by clicking ✅

## Firebase Setup Steps

### 1. Create Firebase Project

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click "Add Project" or "Create a Project"
3. Enter project name (e.g., `collabcanvas-mvp`)
4. Disable Google Analytics (optional for MVP)
5. Click "Create Project"

### 2. Set Up Firebase Authentication

1. In Firebase Console, navigate to **Build > Authentication**
2. Click "Get Started"
3. Enable **Email/Password** provider:
   - Click on "Email/Password"
   - Toggle "Enable" to ON
   - Toggle "Email link (passwordless sign-in)" to OFF (not needed for MVP)
   - Click "Save"
4. Enable **Google** provider:
   - Click on "Google"
   - Toggle "Enable" to ON
   - Select support email from dropdown
   - Click "Save"

### 3. Set Up Cloud Firestore

1. In Firebase Console, navigate to **Build > Firestore Database**
2. Click "Create Database"
3. **Select Mode**: Choose **Production Mode** (recommended)
   - Production mode starts with secure rules
   - You'll update rules later in deployment
4. **Select Location**: Choose closest region to your users
   - `us-central` (Iowa) - Good for North America
   - `europe-west1` (Belgium) - Good for Europe
   - `asia-northeast1` (Tokyo) - Good for Asia
   - **Note**: Location cannot be changed later
5. Click "Enable"

**Production vs Development Mode:**
- **Production Mode** (✅ Recommended): Restrictive rules from start, more secure
- **Development Mode** (❌ Not Recommended): Open access for 30 days, security risk

### 4. Set Up Realtime Database

1. In Firebase Console, navigate to **Build > Realtime Database**
2. Click "Create Database"
3. **Select Location**: Choose same or nearby region as Firestore
4. **Select Mode**: Choose **Locked Mode** (recommended)
   - Locked mode denies all access by default
   - You'll add proper rules later
5. Click "Enable"

**Locked vs Test Mode:**
- **Locked Mode** (✅ Recommended): All read/write denied by default
- **Test Mode** (❌ Not Recommended): All read/write allowed, major security risk

### 5. Get Firebase Configuration

1. In Firebase Console, go to **Project Settings** (gear icon)
2. Scroll down to "Your apps" section
3. Click **Web** icon (`</>`) to add a web app
4. Register app:
   - App nickname: `CollabCanvas Web`
   - Firebase Hosting: Check this box (you'll use it for deployment)
   - Click "Register app"
5. Copy the configuration object:
   ```javascript
   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "...",
     authDomain: "...",
     projectId: "...",
     storageBucket: "...",
     messagingSenderId: "...",
     appId: "...",
     databaseURL: "..."
   };
   ```
6. Paste these values into your `.env` file with `VITE_` prefix

### 6. Initial Security Rules (For Development)

**Firestore Rules** (Basic authenticated-only access):
```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /canvas/{canvasId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

**Realtime Database Rules** (Basic authenticated-only access):
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "sessions": {
      "$canvasId": {
        ".read": "auth != null",
        ".write": "auth != null"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: You'll update these rules with better validation in PR #9.

## Application Constants

### Canvas Configuration (`src/utils/constants.ts`)

```typescript
// Canvas dimensions
export const CANVAS_WIDTH = 5000;
export const CANVAS_HEIGHT = 5000;

// Viewport dimensions (calculated dynamically)
// VIEWPORT_WIDTH = window.innerWidth
// VIEWPORT_HEIGHT = window.innerHeight - navbarHeight

// Zoom constraints
export const MIN_ZOOM = 0.1;
export const MAX_ZOOM = 3;
export const ZOOM_STEP = 0.1;

// Shape defaults
export const DEFAULT_SHAPE_WIDTH = 100;
export const DEFAULT_SHAPE_HEIGHT = 100;
export const DEFAULT_SHAPE_FILL = '#cccccc';

// Lock timeout (milliseconds)
export const LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS = 5000; // 5 seconds
export const LOCK_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS = 2000; // Check every 2 seconds

// Cursor update throttling
export const CURSOR_UPDATE_THROTTLE_MS = 33; // ~30 FPS (meets <50ms requirement)
export const CURSOR_POSITION_THRESHOLD_PX = 2; // Only update if moved >2px

// Display name constraints
export const MAX_DISPLAY_NAME_LENGTH = 20;
```

### User Color Palette (`src/utils/constants.ts`)

**Requirements:**
- 8-10 distinct colors
- High contrast against white/light backgrounds
- Easily distinguishable from each other
- Professional and visually appealing

```typescript
export const USER_COLORS = [
  '#FF6B6B', // Red
  '#4ECDC4', // Teal
  '#45B7D1', // Blue
  '#FFA07A', // Light Salmon
  '#98D8C8', // Mint
  '#F7DC6F', // Yellow
  '#BB8FCE', // Purple
  '#85C1E2', // Sky Blue
  '#F8B739', // Orange
  '#52B788', // Green
] as const;

export type UserColor = typeof USER_COLORS[number];
```

**Color Selection Logic:**
```typescript
// Deterministic color assignment based on userId
export function generateUserColor(userId: string): string {
  const hash = userId.split('').reduce((acc, char) => {
    return char.charCodeAt(0) + ((acc << 5) - acc);
  }, 0);
  const index = Math.abs(hash) % USER_COLORS.length;
  return USER_COLORS[index];
}
```

---

## Lock Timeout Configuration

### Hybrid Lock Timeout Strategy

**Client-Side Timer:**
- Check for stale locks every 2 seconds (`LOCK_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS`)
- Release locks older than 5 seconds (`LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS`)
- Implemented in `src/hooks/useCanvas.ts`

**Server-Side (RTDB onDisconnect):**
- When user disconnects, clear their locked shapes
- Implemented in `src/services/presence.ts`
- Uses Firebase RTDB `onDisconnect()` callback

**Lock Flow:**
1. User starts dragging shape → Lock acquired (set `isLocked: true`, `lockedBy: userId`, `lockedAt: timestamp`)
2. User finishes dragging → Lock released immediately
3. If user doesn't release (crash/disconnect):
   - Client-side: Other users detect stale lock after 5 seconds and clear it
   - Server-side: `onDisconnect()` clears all user's locks when they disconnect
4. Visual feedback: Locked shapes show colored border matching locker's cursor color

**Implementation Notes:**
- Store `lockedAt` timestamp in Firestore
- Store `lockedShapes` array in RTDB for quick disconnect cleanup
- Check timestamp on client-side: `Date.now() - lockedAt > LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS`
- Prevents race conditions with "first lock wins" strategy

### Common Issues

**1. Firebase config not found:**
- Ensure `.env` file exists in project root
- Verify all `VITE_FIREBASE_*` variables are set
- Restart dev server after changing `.env`

**2. TypeScript errors:**
- Run `npm install --save-dev @types/react @types/react-dom`
- Run `tsc --noEmit` to see all type errors
- Check `tsconfig.json` includes `"jsx": "react-jsx"`

**3. Cursor positions not syncing:**
- Verify Realtime Database URL in `.env`
- Check RTDB security rules allow authenticated access
- Check browser console for RTDB connection errors

**4. Shapes not persisting:**
- Verify Firestore is enabled in Firebase Console
- Check Firestore security rules
- Look for errors in browser console

**5. Authentication not working:**
- Verify Auth providers enabled in Firebase Console
- For Google login: Ensure authorized domain added (localhost for dev)
- Check Firebase Auth config in `.env`

## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Performance Metrics

- **60 FPS** during pan/zoom operations
- **<100ms** for shape synchronization
- **<50ms** for cursor position updates
- **500+ shapes** without FPS drops
- **5+ concurrent users** without degradation

### Monitoring Performance

```typescript
// FPS monitoring (add to Canvas component during development)
let frameCount = 0;
let lastTime = performance.now();

function measureFPS() {
  frameCount++;
  const currentTime = performance.now();
  if (currentTime >= lastTime + 1000) {
    console.log(`FPS: ${frameCount}`);
    frameCount = 0;
    lastTime = currentTime;
  }
  requestAnimationFrame(measureFPS);
}

// Start monitoring
measureFPS();
```

### Optimization Checklist

- [ ] Use React.memo for cursor components
- [ ] Throttle cursor updates to 30-40ms
- [ ] Use Konva caching for static shapes
- [ ] Batch Firestore writes when possible
- [ ] Use Firestore offline persistence
- [ ] Implement debouncing for zoom events
- [ ] Use CSS transforms for cursor positioning
- [ ] Optimize re-renders with proper React keys
